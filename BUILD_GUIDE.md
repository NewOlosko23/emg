   ```

### Build Commands

   npm install
   ```

2. **Build Debug APK**
   ```bash

   npx react-native run-android --variant=debug
   
   # Method 2: Using Gradle directly
   cd android
   .\gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

3. **Build Release APK**
   ```bash
   cd android
   .\gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

### APK Location

After successful build, your APK will be located at:
- **Debug APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Release APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Alternative: Using Android Studio

1. Open `EMG_Mobile/android` folder in Android Studio
2. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
3. Go to **Build** → **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** → **Build APK(s)**
4. APK will be generated in the same location

### Testing on Android Device

1. **Enable Developer Options** on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings → About Phone

   - Go back to Settings → Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. **Install APK**:

   - Install using file manager or ADB

3. **ADB Install** (if ADB is configured):

   adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

### Troubleshooting

**If you get Java errors:**
- Ensure JAVA_HOME is set correctly
- Restart command prompt/PowerShell
- Verify Java version: `java -version`

**If you get Android SDK errors:**
- Install Android SDK through Android Studio
- Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
- Install required SDK platforms

**If build fails:**
- Clean project: `cd android && .\gradlew clean`
- Clear Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
- Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Quick Test Build (If Environment is Ready)

```bash
# From EMG_Mobile directory
npm install
npx react-native run-android
